# Yahoo_finance_scraper
Test assessment by Introlab.
Scraper uses Selenium with Chrome Driver so you should have Google Chrome browser installed.

If have any other browser and want to use it instead of Google Chrome, then you should comment line 25 in scrape.py and uncomment line with browser you want to use(Located under Chrome's line).
## Running all the stuff
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/Kirom/Yahoo_finance_scraper.git`
2. Create virtualenv, for example: `python3 -m venv venv` or `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
3. Activate it `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install all the packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. [Alternative] Change browser you want to use in scrape.py
6. Start scraper script `python scrape.py`
